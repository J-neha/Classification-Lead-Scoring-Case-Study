# Classification-Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

*Problem Statement:*
An education company sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. Once people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at company is around 30%

The company wants us to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

Objective:

- To build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
